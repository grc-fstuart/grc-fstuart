            <h2>Target audience</h2>

            <p>The people who use my site are primarily hobby sewists, cosplayers, quilters, and those who run sewing-oriented small businesses like Etsy shops.</p>

                <h1>Sewing Machine Maintenance</h1>

                <p>Yes! We repair sewing machines. All makes -- All models</p>
                <p>
                    A well-made sewing machine should operate perfectly for many years -- if it's cared for, that is. Like cars, sewing machines do need some TLC in order to remain dependable. With proper care, all machines – sewing,
                    embroidery, quilting or serger – will continue to operate beautifully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Industry standard is that all sewing machines get a basic service check every 1 to 2 years. It's amazing the amount of lint that builds up inside your sewing machine where you never see it. Stray threads, dust, and lint
                    from fabric and batting can build up in your machine. With time, the debris can cause tension problems and even damage your machine. In addition, many modern sewing machines do not require oiling, which means this is
                    done when the machine is serviced. Sewing machine oil is a very lightweight oil and it does evaporate over a period of years. Regular service means the oil is always fresh and the machine will run smoother for longer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bring in your machine any time during our standard business hours. No appointment is necessary. Just let us know if it's for an annual service check, or if there's a problem tell us exactly what the machine is doing.
                    We'll give you an estimate, check-in your machine and take a deposit. If the technician discovers more than the estimate covered, we'll call you to discuss options. When it's ready for pick-up, we'll call you with the
                    balance due upon receipt.
